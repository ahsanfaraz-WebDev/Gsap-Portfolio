# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves redesigning the Words That Inspire section to provide a completely new visual experience for screens from 0px to 1350px width. The current bulb/canvas-based design will be replaced with a modern, minimalist black and white design that maintains the same level of visual excellence while being more performant and accessible across all devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile/tablet user, I want the project cards to have minimal hover animations so that the interface feels responsive and doesn't interfere with touch interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over project cards on mobile devices THEN the hover animations SHALL be significantly reduced or disabled
2. WHEN a user interacts with project cards on touch devices THEN the animations SHALL be optimized for touch interactions
3. IF the screen width is below 768px THEN hover effects SHALL be minimized to improve performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing the Words That Inspire section on any screen size from 0-1350px, I want to see a completely new design that replaces the current bulb animation with a modern black and white aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen width is between 0px and 1350px THEN the bulb/canvas design SHALL be completely replaced
2. WHEN viewing the new design THEN it SHALL use only black and white colors to match the website's aesthetic
3. WHEN the new design loads THEN it SHALL maintain the same level of visual excellence as the current design
4. WHEN users interact with the new design THEN it SHALL provide engaging animations and interactions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the new Words That Inspire design to display quotes in an innovative and visually appealing way that doesn't rely on canvas or physics animations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quotes are displayed THEN they SHALL be presented in a modern, grid-based or card-based layout
2. WHEN users interact with quotes THEN there SHALL be subtle, performant animations
3. WHEN the design renders THEN it SHALL be fully responsive across all screen sizes from 0-1350px
4. WHEN quotes are shown THEN they SHALL maintain excellent readability and typography

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new design to be more performant than the current canvas-based solution while maintaining visual appeal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new design loads THEN it SHALL not use canvas or physics libraries
2. WHEN animations run THEN they SHALL be CSS-based or lightweight JavaScript animations
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the performance SHALL be improved compared to the current implementation
4. WHEN users scroll or interact THEN the animations SHALL be smooth and not cause performance issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on larger screens (above 1350px), I want to continue seeing the current bulb design so that the desktop experience remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen width is above 1350px THEN the current bulb design SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN switching between screen sizes THEN the transition SHALL be seamless
3. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN all current functionality SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the new design to include interactive elements that allow me to engage with the inspirational quotes in meaningful ways.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing quotes THEN there SHALL be interactive elements like hover effects or click interactions
2. WHEN interacting with quotes THEN there SHALL be visual feedback
3. WHEN quotes are displayed THEN they SHALL include category tags and author information
4. WHEN users engage with the content THEN the interactions SHALL feel intuitive and responsive
